To get the data and run this code:

- Make sure that the Jupyter notebook is in the same folder as the images. Then, run all cells. This should give you example images that my model outputs that can be seen at the end of the file.
- If you would like to get all the data and retrain the model, the code for entering your kaggle information is at the top of the file. Uncomment this, fill in your information, and run the file. 

Evidence of experimentation: 

- My experimentation can be seen as this link, where all the model versions that I found to be relevant are saved: https://wandb.ai/sd-team/bmia-project/table?nw=nwusersdhuri 
- You can also see outputs for different model versions saved in the folder "bmia images"
